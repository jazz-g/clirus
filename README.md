# clirus
A tiny CLI RSS/Atom feed reader for the terminal.
clirus simply gets a list of feed urls, and keeps track of a multiple feeds and merges them into one feed.
It does this by keeping track of a queue object of n length and when the clirus script is run, it will output the titles of the articles in the queue.
This script is useful for desktop widgets.<br/>

I will be maintaining this script to the bare minimum so that it just works.
